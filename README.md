# Team15_SelfIdea

Project Overview:
This project aims to develop a system that allows college students to plan their courses across eight semesters. The system will provide a clear visualization of potential academic paths, validate course plans based on completed prerequisites,
and offer pre-existing templates tailored to students' interests and desired graduation timelines.
Students will be able to upload their course history (by manually filling their course history or submitting their unofficial transcript from SPIRE) and then select future courses to meet their credit requirements. Once a course plan is created,
the system will validate it against existing degree requirements and indicate whether it is valid.
This tool will also assist peer mentors and academic advisors by providing a standardized format for reviewing student plans, making advising sessions more efficient. The system is designed to support all majors through configuration files
uploaded by academic advisors from the admin side. These files will define major requirements, prerequisite courses, and general education requirements for the available courses. For this project, we will use UMassâ€™s Computer Science curriculum as our example.
Ultimately, this platform will allow students to create and refine their course plans online, enabling advisors to access them before meetings, leading to more effective and personalized academic guidance.
